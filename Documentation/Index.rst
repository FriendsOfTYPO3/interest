:Description:
   REST and CLI API for adding, updating, and deleting records in TYPO3. The
   extension tracks relations, so records can be inserted in any order. Uses
   remote ID mapping so you don't have to keep track of what UID a record has
   gotten after import. Data is inserted using backend APIs as if a real human
   did it, so you can can inspect the record history and undo actions.
