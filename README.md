# Integration REST API

REST and CLI API for adding, updating, and deleting records in TYPO3. The
extension tracks relations, so records can be inserted in any order. Uses
remote ID mapping so you don't have to keep track of what UID a record has
gotten after import. Data is inserted using backend APIs as if a real human
did it, so you can can inspect the record history and undo actions.
